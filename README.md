Put the file "hw1" in your htdocs folder. Open that folder in VSCode for you to start editing
I would also recommend you get the "Live Server" extention. There's no setup required. Right-click the html document and select open in live server. That extension updates everytime you save the file unlike the other extension that has to be refreshed everytime.
